# clj-dde

A Clojure library (really a wrapper around the Java DDE library provided by pretty_tools) to interoperate with DDE (dynamic data exchange) sources.

## Rationale

1. Sometimes you need to connect to a DDE source, and
2. would rather do it in Clojure > Java

## Usage

When you need to connect with a DDE data source...


## Setup

`lein javac` to compile the java files.

## Issues

If you get the message "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no JavaDDEx64 in java.library.path"  you need to add the javaDDE64.dll file (in /resources) to your classpath:

(System/getProperty "java.library.path") to find out
