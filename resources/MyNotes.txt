To connect to two MT4 instances:

this one is free and you don't have to install, just run it.

get it from:  http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm

If you open the terminal.exe file in the MT4 root directory with the HEX editor and do a search for MT4 you will find 7 instances. Simply change MT4 to MT1 and the DDE server name will change to MT1. In Excel you just use ='MT1'|BID!EURUSD for example. I can not take credit for this as it was passed to me thru another conversation, but I think it is ok to share.
