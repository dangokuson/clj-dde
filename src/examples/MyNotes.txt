To connect to two MT4 instances:

this one is free and you don't have to install, just run it.

get it from:  http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm

If you open the terminal.exe file in the MT4 root directory with the HEX editor and do a search for MT4 you will find 7 instances. Simply change MT4 to MT1 and the DDE server name will change to MT1. In Excel you just use ='MT1'|BID!EURUSD for example. I can not take credit for this as it was passed to me thru another conversation, but I think it is ok to share.




;; Make Excel a DDE Server

=Excel|[stock.xls]Sheet1!'r2c2'






;; sample program:

        DDEClient client;
        Conversation conv = null;
        byte[] data=null;
        client = DDEClient.getInstance();
        try {
            conv = client.connect("MT4", "BID");
            System.out.println("Connected to MT4");
            String Topic= conv.getTopic();
            data=conv.request("EURUSD", 5000);
            String sEURUSD = new String(data);
            System.out.println("EURUSD value: " + sEURUSD);
        } catch(DDEException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        } finally {
            // disconnect in a finally clause
            try {conv.close();} catch (Exception e) {}
        }
        client.close();
